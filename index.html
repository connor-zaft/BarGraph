    <h1>Torres Claims He Wants To Save The Bronx. What Will His Donors Think?</h1>
     <p>By: Connor Zaft</p>
      <P>Nov. 15th, 2020</P>

    <p>Former City Councilman Ritchie Torres recently won his race for New York's 15th Congressional District. Torres represents a historical moment, as the first openly gay Afro-Latino Congressman. He has frequently talked about spending his
      youth in NYCHA housing, and campaigned on increasing affordable housing in the South Bronx. However, according to his FEC filings, Torres may be running into a conflict of interest. As the graph below demonstrates, Torres' top contributors have
      much to lose if he lives up to his campaign promises.</p>

    <iframe title="Ritchie Torres Campaign Contributors" aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-nwsPQ" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/nwsPQ/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;"

    <script type="text/javascript">
      ! function() {
        "use strict";
        window.addEventListener("message", (function(a) {
          if (void 0 !== a.data["datawrapper-height"])
            for (var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]) {
              var t = document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-" + e) || document.querySelector("iframe[src*='" + e + "']");
              t && (t.style.height = a.data["datawrapper-height"][e] + "px")
            }
        }))
      }();
    </script>




    <p>Not mentioned above are the questionable legal histories of the campaigns top donors. For example, A&E Real Estate has been wrapped up in a class action lawsuit for gouging rents. The Krauss Organization, a NYCHA property manager, owed New
      York City millions in taxes. Mountco Construction and Development has been accused of shorting payments to workers and maintaining unsafe work sites. </p>
